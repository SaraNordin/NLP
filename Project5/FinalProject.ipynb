    "Optical Character Recognition, or OCR for short, is the process of taking an image of text and making it machine readable. This technique is dependent on two areas of machine learning: computer vision and natural language processing. One needs a good vision model to identify words and paragraphs, and ideally also a language model that tries to find and adjust any errors outputted from the scanned text. Here, we will focus on the second stage of the OCR process. \n",

    "for a given vision output: different levels of sophistication to detect and correct for errors in the text. \n",
    "When a pair of letters are confused for another letter of a similar shape, such as 'rn' and 'm', we call this character elision. Seems relatively common, and this could be adjusted using NLP methods. \n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Two outcomes when elision happens: either the resulting word is a ''legal error'' (the resulting word is still a part of the English language, modern becomes modem), or it outputs nonsense. The first case would require quite advanced, and expensive, language modelling to score each word in the corpus and attempt to correct the ones that don't seem to match the context. In the cases where the eliased word is not a valid English word, it's of course easier to find. \n",
